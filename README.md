# Avocado

This project is a growing set of reusable React components made to make frontend development faster and easier. The idea is simple: drop in a component, pass a few props to customize it, and you're good to go. Whether you're building something small or scaling up a larger app, these components are designed to be flexible and easy to work withâ€”just keep what you need and tweak the rest. It's all about saving time, staying consistent, and focusing more on building great user experiences.
